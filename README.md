## Hi, I am a Game Developer & Systems Designer
I'm fascinated by the process of turning complex ideas into interactive experiences, and I love exploring how to architect the rules and systems that make a world feel truly alive.<br>
<br>
My current journey is focused on:<br>
◆ Building a strong foundation in software engineering and object-oriented principles.<br>
◆ Diving deep into the core principles of game design and algorithms.<br>
◆ Conceptualizing and outlining the world and systems for my first independent game.<br>
◆ Learning the art of 3D modeling with Blender to give my ideas visual form.<br>
<br>
I'm on a continuous journey of learning and creation. I'm always open to connecting with fellow creators and developers. Feel free to reach out if you want to talk about system design, world-building, or if you have a project we could bring to life together.
